## Habitica
Habitica is a free habit building and productivity app that treats your real life like a game. With in-game rewards and punishments to motivate you.

## Kodi
Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation, a non-profit technology consortium.

### Note
This repository is an intermediary repository to get the confirmation of both Habitica team and Kodi team. As soon as I'm able to get a release candidate, the project will be moved to script.habitica or whatever meets Kodi's standards.
